Now I assume that R and RStudio are correctly installed on your computer. You can start by opening RStudio. You will see a lot of things on your screen, many blocks, many menus, and it can be quite overwhelming. No worries! This is exactly what this section is about!

<p class="notice--warning"><strong> :book: Objectives</strong><br>In this section, you will learn more about the RStudio interface and get familiarized with it.<br>
But this section is not only about presenting the interface! In addition to that, you will also get familiar with the very basics of R language.<br></p>
 
## 1. The interface of RStudio
### 1.1	General overview of the interface: Blocks, blocks, blocks and blocks
You may see the following picture on your screen after opening RStudio:

The best way to apprehend RStudio is to understand the interface as <b>blocks</b>, which are here for different purposes.

<p class="notice--danger">&#9888; When you open RStudio for the very first time, you should get something similar as in the image above, with three blocks in the same order. But it's also possible that you have something else. If that's the case, this is completely normal and this won't affect anything for the following steps! </p>

There are four main blocks, as in the following image. I give them unofficial names so that it will be easier to refer to them. There is one block that I call the 'computer block', a second one the 'data block', a third one the 'script block', and finally the last one, the 'console block'.

You may not be able to see the 'console block' on your computer for the moment, and again, this is completely normal! Just follow the steps below.

### 1.2	The computer block
The 'computer block' is 
### 1.3	The variable block
### 1.4	The script block
### 1.5	The console block
### Exercise: Play with your blocks!
Your four blocks are like construction toys you can play with. You can make them disappear and then reappear, you can change their size as you wish, and you can even change the background color. In other words, make RStudio your own!

This is how you can change the size of the blocks with your mouse:

This is how you change the background color of RStudio:

<p class="notice--info"> <strong> Anecdote </strong> <br> I personally change the sizes of the blocks dynamically, depending on the task I'm doing. For example, if I'm writing more complex lines of codes which could be confusing, I enlarge the script block to be sure I'm not missing any parenthesis or comma. When I'm drawing plots, I make the computer block bigger to visualize more clearly what I'm doing, and it helps me to know if I want to add or change anything on the plot.<br>
  Everyone's experience is different, it just depends on what your preferences are. So, really, make it your own! </p>
